//Here is an example of workingn code for a 3d rts implementation based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GfdKB_7mrY
//It'll need some care to work properly for a 2d engine as I think we planned. I'm just putting it here as an example for the time being.

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine AI;

public class UnitMove : MonoBehaviour
{
    Camera cam;
    NavMeshAgent agent;
    public LayerMask ground;

    private void start()
    {
        cam = Camera.main;
        agent = getComponent < NavMeshAgent>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1))
        {
            RaycastHit hit;
            Ray ray = cam.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);

            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, Mathf.Infinity, ground))
            {
                agent.SetDestination(hit.point);
            }
        }
    }

}
